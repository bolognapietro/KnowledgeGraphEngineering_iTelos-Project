    \item Did the project respect the scheduling expected in the beginning ?
    \item Are the final results able to satisfy the initial Purpose ?

        \end{itemize}

The description of open issues has to provide a clear explanation about the problems, the approaches adopted while trying to solve them and, eventually, any proposed solution that has not been applied.\\
